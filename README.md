# Introduction #

This plugin for OmniOutliner allows you to export as a text file, suitable for
processing through Markdown or MultiMarkdown. For more information, please
see:

<http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/multimarkdown_and_omnioutliner/>

This script is "agnostic" as to the version of MultiMarkdown syntax being
used, so it is compatible with MMD 2, or MMD 3.
